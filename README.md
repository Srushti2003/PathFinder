# PathFinder 🎯
**Career Suggestion System using Machine Learning**

PathFinder is an intelligent machine learning-powered application that helps students and professionals discover career options tailored to their interests, skills, and domain knowledge. It uses multiple datasets across various domains like IT, Medical, and Design to provide accurate suggestions.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts suitable career paths based on user input
- Supports domain-specific career suggestions (IT/CS, Medical, Design)
- User-friendly Flask web interface
- Trained models integrated using Pickle
- Clean and modular Python code

## 📁 Datasets Used
- `Career_Prediction_ITCS_Improved.csv` – Dataset for IT/Computer Science careers
- `medical_career_dataset.csv` – Dataset for medical field career predictions
- `design_career_dataset.csv` – Dataset for creative and design-related career options

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
- Data Preprocessing: Handling nulls, Label Encoding, Feature Scaling
- Model Training: Classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Model Saving: Trained models and encoders stored using `Pickle`
- Deployment: Integrated with a Flask web application for user interaction

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- HTML/CSS (basic frontend)
